  Reflect:
Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
    I think I can. Even though I I don't have too many commits, all of my commits so far have been labeled accordingly, and I can easily track what I have done in the past, 
    and what I need to do in the future
How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
    I would say 100% of the time, my commits reflected accuratley and exactly what I was working on during the time of the commit. For an example,
    my commit for this reflection will be that I uploaded a screen shot, and that I asnwered all the questions. For the other commit, it was also an accurate reflectino
    of what I was doing, which was adding facts about myself.
How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
    In the future, not just for computer science, but also for any other subjects in school, and even in my future jobs, keeping track of whatever work I have previously
    done, helps not only me to keep track of where I am in my work, but also for other people who are also working on the same assignment as me and they need to understand what 
    they need to do, so everyone can keep funcitoning and moving forward.
