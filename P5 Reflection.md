  What was challenging during this process?
The hardest part of this process was figuring out how to color individual shapes, because everytime I tried, it wouldn't work and would be very buggy.
  
  What makes more sense now then it did before you started?
What makes the most sense now after asking around and doing some research is how to color individual shapes. My prior knowledge wasn't really applicable to 
what I was trying to do here, and it was slightly frustrating, and upsetting.
 
  What are you proud of?
I am really proud of how I was able to work around the issue of not being able to understand something, and how it turned out in the end.
