  What was challenging during this process?
The hardest part of this process was figuring out how to color individual shapes because every time I tried, it wouldn't work and would be very buggy.
  
  What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
After asking around and doing some research, what makes the most sense is how to color individual shapes. My prior knowledge didn't apply to 
what I was trying to do here, and it was slightly frustrating and upsetting.
 
  What are you proud of?
I am proud of how I worked around the issue of being unable to understand something, and how it turned out in the end.
